167,Eastern Kentucky University,Minor in Disaster Management (Online),"What do earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, wildfires, building collapses, hazardous material incidents, pandemics, and terrorist attacks have in common?

Consider the social impacts of terrorism, or the environmental consequences associated with oil spills. The economic disruptions caused by hurricanes and wildfires are significant and reach well beyond local, state, and national boundaries. In fact, disasters commonly disrupt the economy, the operation of businesses, infrastructure systems, and government services. Regrettably, they may also result in loss of life and damage to property and the environment.

Experts predict that the frequency of extreme events and their costs will continue to climb. To help confront this challenge, the Disaster Management concentration at Eastern Kentucky University provides students with an opportunity to study disaster phenomena and formulate 21st century mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery strategies. Courses offered in support of this concentration provide applied and experiential learning environments in the form of disaster simulations and exercises, and reinforce many professional skills, such as risk and geospatial analysis and planning associated with disaster resilience.

201,Florida International University,Bachelor of Arts in Disaster Management,"In a catastrophic disaster, there is a real need for educated professionals who can provide on-site disaster command and control, interface with local, state and federal leaders, manage multi-million-dollar projects and implement disaster preparedness measures. Disaster Management practitioners are at the forefront of planning, mitigation, response and recovery operations. An educated emergency manager is also important because they influence the readiness of a community and ingrain a culture of preparedness. Successful emergency managers have knowledge in many areas, including public safety and security, public health, administration and management, law and government, communication, technology, and much more. FIU's Bachelor of Arts in Disaster Management will support these educational objectives and prepare our students to serve effectively in these roles.

Upon successful completion of the program, students will possess knowledge of the history of disasters; be well-versed in the definition, mission, concepts and terminology applied in emergency and disaster management; demonstrate a solid grounding in social, political, and the mitigation of disasters; possess a firm grasp of the statutory and regulatory basis of disaster management; identify and define areas of disaster management responsibility including mitigation opportunities, planning, training, exercises, warning, evacuation, sheltering, damage assessment, feeding, and medical care; recognize the importance of public, private and nongovernmental organization networking to facilitate collaboration and cooperation; understand the importance of communication, coordination and collaboration in disasters; be able to identify the resources needed and how to obtain those resources to assist survivors; describe the various hazards and the organization needed to reduce the threat; identify the core requirements to effective planning; demonstrate how to perform vulnerability analysis; be able to recognize and apply the appropriate decision making models; be able to isolate and apply strategic planning; demonstrate recognition of the social and ethical considerations unique to the practice of disaster management. This expertise can be applied locally, domestically or internationally.

Miami is the gateway to the Caribbean as well as Central and South America and in countries with inadequate emergency management programs, it is the international community that responds.

With the growing threat of natural catastrophes, technological disasters, and terrorism, the field of fire protection and emergency management has expanded. Significant resources are devoted by all levels of government to help businesses, communities, states, and federal agencies prepare for, respond to, recover from, and mitigate the effects of disasters. The complexity and scale of disasters requires high levels of leadership, professional competence and competent performance. As a natural outgrowth of the need for more knowledgeable leaders in emergency management, there exists a parallel need to train effective educators and proficient researchers. Our graduates are leaders advancing the science and practice of fire protection and emergency management.

Our program can be completed mainly in hybrid distance courses as well as on campus in the classroom. Distance courses require students to attend class each week through their computer. Students are able to participate in discussion and access the professor directly through their computer. This method of course delivery sets our program apart from other distance education options in Fire and Emergency Management. It allows students to develop relationships with faculty members and other students in the program that are harder to develop in a fully online program. Students are encouraged, but not required, to complete at least one course on the Stillwater campus, as one of the strengths of our program is the network and the bonds developed with fellow FEMP students from across the country. This can be accomplished by attending courses in the summer that are held here in Oklahoma on varying schedules that limit the amount of travel needed.

At Penn College, our Emergency Management and Homeland Security program focuses on real-world skills. The more you learn now, the better you'll be prepared to act in the future. Gain practical skills to tackle all phases of emergencies, disasters, and catastrophes. Then put them to the test in mock crisis activities and other skill-building collaborative exercises.

EHM prepares students for careers in the emergency management or other closely related fields. The curriculum provides students with a comprehensive understanding of the Phases of Emergency Management; FEMAs Core Capabilities; Critical Infrastructure Protection; National Incident Management System (NIMS); Emergency Operations Center (EOC) operations; governmental roles and levels of responsibility; evolution of emergency management from colonial America to present; an understanding of man-made, natural, and technological hazards as they pertain to community vulnerability; current and emerging technological trends in emergency management; and the requisite skills of an effective emergency manager.

Understanding the multidisciplinary nature of this field and the need for emergency managers to engage their partners across all levels of government and the community is a foundational characteristic of this degree program that will shape students careers. In this major, students will complete a general core of math, science, humanities, computer science, and communications courses.

457,Saint John's University,Doctor of Professional Studies in Homeland Security,"Today's security professionals face a myriad of threats and hazards unimaginable just two short decades ago. This dilemma is compounded by advancements in technology and an increasingly complex threat environment from a wide array of natural, man-made, and technological threats and hazards to people, property, the global economy, critical infrastructure, and computer systems, to name just a few. These threats have taken on a global nature with great interconnectivity, interdependency, and an increasing flow of goods, people, and services across borders.

Security professionals charged with analyzing risk and implementing well-considered policies face exceptional challenges in dealing with this complex security environment. In addition, decision-making must comply with their nation's unique legal, political, and social framework. An understanding of the global dynamics undergirding these issues requires a multidisciplinary approach that explores this reality. This reality has created a demand for a new generation of highly educated leaders in both the private and public sectors of the Homeland Security Enterprise, as well as academics who will teach the next generation of security professionals and conduct innovative research in the field.

You can gain the knowledge, skills, and, credentials to meet these needs, and conduct research more effectively; think both analytically and critically; build and manage teams; and make decisions and apply knowledge to effectively solve real-world security challenges through the Doctor of Professional Studies program in Homeland Security(DPS) at St. John's University---one of the first nonprofit educational institutions offering doctoral-level studies specifically in homeland security.

Offered by St. John's College of Professional Studies, this innovative 78-credit program is designed to qualify candidates to fill mid- to high-level executive positions in government, law enforcement, the public and private security industries, nongovernmental organizations, and academia. Students will research and explore the practice of such collaborative efforts; gain an understanding of the range of local, national, international and organizational security issues faced by public and private actors and entities within the Homeland Security Enterprise; apply this knowledge to issues of policy- and decision-making, organizational design, leadership, and administrative practices; and focus heavily on the practice of emergency and disaster preparedness, including response, recovery, mitigation, and resilience efforts.

Program strengths are in Cybersecurity, disaster assistance and humanitarian response, data fusion, visualization, collaboration especially across the border with Mexican Law Enforcement and a host of agencies and businesses, Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources (CIKR), information decision systems, public health, combatting violent extremism, totalitarian and democratic rhetoric, transnational crime, border security and its linkage to trade, and interaction with wildfires, earthquakes, floods, and other disasters including with social media tools. Our faculty are nearly all accomplished professional Practioners who teach what they do, so there is a deep practical and career focus in the program. Many dozens of Adjunct Faculty from different agencies and companies provide a rich expertise to help with theses, projects, and career entry.

The active participation of graduate students and faculty with community partners is a primary focus of the HSEC Program. Therefore, the program has established a number of collaborative relationships with public, private, and non-profit sector partners on the international, federal, state, and local levels as we require the students to do an Internship (HSEC 695, Practicum), which commonly is a steppingstone to a career. These relationships are evident in both the classroom and through the HSEC Program's global and domestic research initiatives and they allow the homeland security student to engage in a number of service-learning opportunities that make a real-world difference to the safety and security of people and communities around the world.

This complex system of administration presents many challenges for Native Governments, particularly when faced with natural or manmade disasters that threaten tribal lands and interests. These threats to tribal communities are often compounded by a lack of resources existing in reservation populations. Understanding the complex legal, historical, and cultural issues affecting tribal government management and provision of crisis response is essential to provide routine and emergency services to native communities.

These graduate-level courses provide an overview of the entire disaster management system and will focus on specific issues that identify the strengths and weaknesses of the current system. Two major goals of the courses are to engage students' creative processes to facilitate the development and refinement of systems that will work in the community, and to help develop a common conceptual understanding of the issues facing disaster management in order to produce a more coordinated, regional response to an event. Students learn by participating and doing rather than by memorizing.

Courses are not training workshops designed to teach first responder skills. Instead, they are graduate-level learning sessions designed to provide a better understanding of administrative processes and issues surrounding disaster management best practices. A large, systems viewpoint is presented with facilitated discussion to allow students to seek ways to develop or to improve processes in their communities.

If you've been thinking about expanding your individual knowledge or you want to advance your career in disaster management, this program is a perfect fit. We run one cohort of students each year beginning every January. Our application period opens every September through the first week of December for January classes. The certificate is taught entirely online with an optional graduation attendance. There is no on campus time required. You will learn an ""all hazards"" approach to disaster management with an emphasis on building an emergency management system through partnering and networking.

In ""Bachelors"", ""Graduate"", and ""Stand Alone"" sections as we are placed in the university to accept all academic levels of students into the program. Our classes are blended with executive professional students, undergrads and graduate students all participating in classes.

678,"University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill",Certificate in Natural Hazards Resilience,"Eligibility:

The certificate program in Natural Hazards Resilience is open to master's and Ph.D. students from all departments at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill that have identified an advisor in their home department that is willing to work with the head of the Natural Hazards Resilience certificate program or an advisor that is actively participating in the certificate program. The certificate program is open to non-degree-seeking, post-baccalaureate (graduate) students. All students must receive a P or higher in all certificate coursework.

Overview of the Program:

The 10-credit hour certificate program is focused on the study of natural hazards resilience. Emphasis is placed on the nexus between the threats and impacts of natural hazards and disasters on human settlements, including those exacerbated by climate change, and how individuals, organizations, communities, and larger systems of governance prepare for, respond to, mitigate against, recover from, and adapt to these events. The concept of disaster resilience, or ""the ability to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to adverse events"" (National Research Council 2012), serves as a key organizing principle. The curriculum provides students with an academic and practice-based exposure to the science underlying our understanding of natural hazards phenomena and a critical analysis of the policies, programs, and plans in place that are intended to help societies manage the effects of natural hazards and disasters, to include an emphasis on those actions that increase disaster resilience.

Educational Objectives:

-Provide students with the knowledge and experience needed to actively contribute to the study and/or the practice of natural hazards and disaster resilience. More specifically, the certificate will produce well-trained researchers and practitioners who can help the public, non-profit and private sectors become more resilient in the face of natural hazards and disasters and adapt to the effects of a changing climate.

-Attract and teach the next generation of natural hazards and disaster management scholars that are more reflective of the general population. In the case of disaster management, for instance, the field is less diverse than the general population, while those who study and engage in the practice of climate change adaptation comprise a relatively new cohort that is in need of additional scholars and policymakers. As such, the certificate program strives to be inclusive,

as reflected in participation by underrepresented minorities, women, and a mix of students with academic and practice-based career goals.

-Coalesce the world class UNCCH faculty to address one of the most pressing issues of the 21st century, namely reducing the negative effects of natural hazards and disasters on human settlements, including those influenced by a changing climate.

-Develop an ""esprit de corps"" amongst students through the establishment of applied group projects in the classroom, engagement in research with participating faculty, formation of a student association, and exposure to leaders in the field through mentoring programs, a certificate program lecture series, workshops and fieldwork.

Students are strongly encouraged to gain experience through summer internships and/or fieldwork. Students may choose a 3-hour capstone option in fulfillment of the 3-hour elective requirement. This may include either a student internship or fieldwork (see a description of both options in the detailed program description). Capstone courses will follow the rules and procedures established for independent studies (see information on the Office of the University Registrar's website under the title ""UPM #30 Independent Study Policy""). A Maymester Natural Hazards Practicum course may fulfill the elective requirement when offered.

707,Virginia Commonwealth University,Bachelor of Arts in Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness,"Virginia Commonwealth University, L. Douglas Wilder School of Government and Public Affairs, offers a Bachelor of Arts in Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness.

Emergency preparedness has always been a critical aspect of governmental policy at the federal, state and local levels. Response to natural disasters — floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, outbreak of infectious disease — requires predisaster planning, mid-disaster operations and postdisaster reconstruction that can only be carried out successfully through a partnership between all levels of government and between the public sector, private sector and civil society. Since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania the concept of emergency preparedness has been expanded to include the task of homeland security — protecting the U.S. from terrorist-caused disasters. Policy planners and operational responders at all levels of government who had previously focused upon natural disasters now have the added responsibility of preparing for and mitigating the effects of politically inspired terrorist violence.

Students with a B.A. in Homeland Security can pursue a number of employment opportunities: governmental employment at the local, state, and federal level in homeland security and emergency planning/response (Federal Emergency Management Agency and its counterparts at the state level); law enforcement (Justice Dept, FBI, Dept. of Homeland Security); intelligence; research (numerous for-profit consultancy firms on homeland security and emergency preparedness as well as non-profit research organizations are being created); private sector employment with any business that requires emergency planning to protect critical infrastructure (90% of all critical infrastructure in the US is owned by private corporations).

The Bachelor of Arts curriculum in homeland security and emergency preparedness requires a minimum of 120 credits, with at least 36 of those credits in homeland security and emergency preparedness.

The program was reviewed by officials from the US Department of Homeland Security, the US Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Virginia Governor's Office of Public Safety, the Virginia House of Delegates, and the Virginia Department of Emergency Management.

A variety of approved electives are available from other Departments, including Criminal Justice, Political Science, International Studies, and others.
